# Docker

## Introduction

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, 
and management of applications within lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an 
application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across multiple environments. 
This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem, streamlining development and deployment processes.


**Key features of Docker include:**

* Isolation: Each container runs in its own isolated environment, ensuring applications do not interfere with each other.
* Portability: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker, from a developerâ€™s local machine to large-scale production environments.
* Efficiency: Containers are lightweight and share the host system's kernel, making them faster and more efficient than traditional virtual machines.

By using Docker, developers can achieve greater flexibility, efficiency, and reliability in application development and deployment.

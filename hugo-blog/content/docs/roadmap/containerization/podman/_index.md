# Podman

## Introduction

Podman is an open-source container management tool that allows developers to create, manage, and run 
containers without requiring a central daemon. It provides a Docker-compatible command-line 
interface (CLI), making it easy for users familiar with Docker to transition.

**Key features of Podman include:**

* Daemonless Architecture: Unlike Docker, Podman operates without a central daemon, enhancing security and reducing system complexity.
* Rootless Containers: Podman supports running containers without root privileges, increasing security by minimizing the attack surface.
* Compatibility: Podman supports the OCI (Open Container Initiative) standard, ensuring interoperability with Docker containers and other container technologies.

By using Podman, developers can enjoy a secure, efficient, and flexible container management experience, 
especially in environments where daemonless and rootless operations are preferred.

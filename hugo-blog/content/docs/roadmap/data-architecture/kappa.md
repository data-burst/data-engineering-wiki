# Kappa Architecture

## Introduction

**Kappa Architecture** is a data processing paradigm that seamlessly integrates real-time and batch processing into a single system. Unlike the traditional Lambda Architecture, which maintains separate pipelines for batch and real-time data, Kappa Architecture simplifies data processing by focusing solely on streaming data.

Key points about Kappa Architecture:

1. **Unified Processing**: Kappa Architecture eliminates the need for a separate batch layer, reducing latency and complexity. It processes data continuously, making it well-suited for applications requiring real-time insights.

2. **Stream Processing**: The core idea is to leverage stream processing engines to handle large volumes of data in real time. These engines clean, enrich, transform, filter, and aggregate streaming events.

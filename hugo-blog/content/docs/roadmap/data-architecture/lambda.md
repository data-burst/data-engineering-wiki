# Lambda Architecture

## Introduction

**Lambda architecture** is a data-processing architecture designed to handle massive quantities of data by taking advantage of both batch and stream-processing methods. This approach aims to balance latency, throughput, and fault-tolerance. Let's explore the key components of lambda architecture:

1. **Batch Layer**:
   - The batch layer precomputes results using a distributed processing system capable of handling large data volumes.
   - It ensures perfect accuracy by processing all available data when generating views.
   - Output is stored in a read-only database, with updates replacing existing precomputed views.

2. **Speed Layer**:
   - The speed layer processes data streams in real time without fix-ups or completeness requirements.
   - It minimizes latency by providing immediate views into the most recent data.
   - These views may not be as accurate or complete as batch layer views but are available promptly.

3. **Serving Layer**:
   - The serving layer responds to user queries by combining batch and speed layer outputs.
   - It provides comprehensive and timely views of data for various use cases.

# Data Modeling

## Introduction

Data modeling is a critical process in designing databases and data systems, involving the definition and organization of data elements and their relationships. It serves as the blueprint for building a database and guides the development of software applications that interact with data. The goal of data modeling is to ensure data is accurately represented, logically organized, and optimally structured to support both business processes and data analysis.
Three popular data modeling schemas used in modern data warehousing are the Star Schema, Snowflake Schema, and Data Vault. Each has its own strengths and is suited for different scenarios.

### Key Principles of Data Modeling

- **Normalization:** Organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Denormalization:** Occasionally used to enhance performance in read-heavy systems by reducing the number of joins.
- **Integrity Constraints:** Rules that ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.

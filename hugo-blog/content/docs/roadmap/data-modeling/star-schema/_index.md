# Star Schema (Ralph Kimbal)

## Introduction

The Star Schema is a traditional database schema with a central table known as the fact table surrounded by dimension tables, which form a star-like shape. This schema is optimized for querying large data sets and is commonly used in business intelligence and reporting applications.

### Characteristics:

- **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and navigate, with clear relationships between the central fact table (which contains measurable, quantitative data) and dimension tables (which describe attributes related to the data).
- **Performance:** Efficient for read queries due to the denormalized structure, which reduces the number of joins necessary when performing queries.
- **Query Optimization:** Ideal for OLAP systems where query speed is crucial, as it allows for fast aggregation and summarization.

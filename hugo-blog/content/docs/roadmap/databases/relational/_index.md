# Relational Databases

## Introduction

Relational databases are a fundamental part of modern data management. They provide a structured way to store, organize, and access information. The concept of a relational database was first introduced by E.F. Codd in 1970 and has since become the standard for storing data.

Relational databases are based on the relational model, where data is organized into one or more tables. Each table has a unique key and each row in the table represents a unique record. These records are linked to each other through their keys, forming a "relation".

There are several tools available for managing relational databases, including **[PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/)**, **[SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server)**, and **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)**. These tools provide a variety of features for database management, such as data indexing, query optimization, and data integrity enforcement.

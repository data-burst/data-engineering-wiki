## Introduction

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) revolutionizes the way IT infrastructure is managed by 
treating it as software. Instead of manually configuring servers and networks, 
IaC allows for the use of code to automate and manage infrastructure. 
This approach not only streamlines the setup and maintenance of IT environments 
but also ensures consistency and repeatability. By leveraging tools like Terraform, 
Ansible, and CloudFormation, IaC enables the automation of infrastructure 
provisioning and configuration, reducing the risk of human error and enhancing 
scalability. This paradigm shift is particularly beneficial in dynamic, 
cloud-native environments where rapid deployment and scaling are crucial.

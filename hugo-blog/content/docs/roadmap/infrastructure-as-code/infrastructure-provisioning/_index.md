# Infrastructure Provisioning

## Introduction

The implementation of IaC offers substantial advantages in infrastructure 
provisioning, including improved collaboration, accelerated deployment 
cycles, and enhanced disaster recovery capabilities. Tools like Terraform 
facilitate the definition and management of infrastructure across 
various cloud platforms and on-premises environments. IaC makes 
infrastructure modular and reusable, fostering a culture of continuous 
integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). By automating the 
provisioning and configuration processes, IaC enables teams to focus 
on innovation rather than manual setup, ensuring that infrastructure 
provisioning is aligned with the dynamic requirements of the business.



## Terraform

Terraform is a powerful open-source tool developed by HashiCorp that enables 
infrastructure as code (IaC) for provisioning and managing cloud and 
on-premises infrastructure. It uses a high-level configuration language, 
HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), to define the desired state of 
infrastructure resources. With Terraform, users can create, update, 
and version infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable manner. It 
supports a wide range of cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google 
Cloud, and many others, making it a versatile tool for managing 
multi-cloud environments.

One of the key strengths of Terraform is its state management and execution 
plan features. Terraform maintains a state file that tracks the current state 
of the infrastructure, enabling it to determine what changes need to be 
applied to achieve the desired state. Before making any modifications, Terraform 
generates an execution plan that details the changes it will make, providing 
a clear and predictable way to manage infrastructure updates. This ensures 
that infrastructure changes are deliberate and controlled, reducing the risk 
of errors. Additionally, Terraform's modular approach allows for the reuse 
of configuration code, promoting best practices and efficiency in infrastructure 
provisioning and management.

# HTTPS

## Introduction

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of HTTP that adds a layer of security through encryption. It ensures that data exchanged between the client and server remains confidential and tamper-proof.

1. **TLS/SSL Encryption**: HTTPS uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to encrypt data. This prevents eavesdropping and unauthorized access.

2. **Certificates**: Websites using HTTPS obtain SSL/TLS certificates from certificate authorities. These certificates verify the authenticity of the server and enable secure communication.

3. **Port 443**: HTTPS typically operates on port 443, while HTTP uses port 80. Browsers automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS for secure connections.

4. **Mixed Content**: Mixing HTTP and HTTPS content on a page can lead to security warnings. Always strive for a fully secure experience.

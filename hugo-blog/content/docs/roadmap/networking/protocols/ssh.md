# SSH

## Introduction

**Secure Shell (SSH)** is a network protocol that provides a secure way for two computers to connect remotely. SSH employs encryption to ensure that hackers cannot interpret the traffic between two connected devices. It is a method for securely sending commands to a computer over an unsecured network. SSH uses cryptography to authenticate and encrypt connections between devices. SSH also allows for tunneling, or port forwarding, which is when data packets are able to cross networks that they would not otherwise be able to cross. SSH is often used for controlling servers remotely, for managing infrastructure, and for transferring files.

SSH runs on top of the TCP/IP protocol suite. It sets up a connection between a user's device and a faraway machine, often a server. It uses encryption to scramble the data that traverses the connection. An intercepting party would only find something like static â€” random data that means nothing unless it is decrypted.

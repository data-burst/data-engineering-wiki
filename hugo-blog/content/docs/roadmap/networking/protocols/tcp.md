# TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

## Introduction

**TCP/IP** is a suite of communication protocols that define the standards for transmitting data over computer networks, including the internet. The TCP/IP protocol is the foundation of the internet and enables devices to communicate with each other using a common language.

TCP/IP was designed and developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1960s and is based on standard protocols. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike the seven layers in the OSI model.

The main work of TCP/IP is to transfer the data of a computer from one device to another. The main condition of this process is to make data reliable and accurate so that the receiver will receive the same information which is sent by the sender. To ensure that, each message reaches its final destination accurately, the TCP/IP model divides its data into packets and combines them at the other end, which helps in maintaining the accuracy of the data while transferring from one end to another end.

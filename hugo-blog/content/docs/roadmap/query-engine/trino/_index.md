# Trino

## Introduction
Trino, formerly known as PrestoSQL, is an open-source distributed SQL query engine designed for running fast, interactive analytic queries on large datasets. Trino can query data across multiple sources, making it a powerful tool for data warehousing, data lakes, and real-time analytics.

## Key Features
1. **Distributed Query Processing:**
- Executes queries across multiple nodes, offering high performance and scalability.
- Optimized for interactive, low-latency query execution.

2. **SQL Compatibility:**
- Supports standard ANSI SQL, making it accessible to users familiar with SQL.
- Advanced SQL features, including window functions, arrays, and nested data types.

3. **Data Source Integration:**
- Connects to a wide range of data sources: HDFS, S3, relational databases, NoSQL databases, and other data stores.
- Unified interface to query data across different storage systems.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
- Cost-Based Optimizer: Uses statistics to choose the most efficient execution plan.
- In-Memory Processing: Reduces query latency by processing data in memory.

5. **Extensibility:**
- Connector Architecture: Easily add new data sources by developing custom connectors.
- Support for User-Defined Functions (UDFs): Create custom functions to extend query capabilities.

6. **Fault Tolerance and Reliability:**
- Designed for high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring robust query execution even during node failures.

### Architecture
1. **Coordinator:**
- Manages the query lifecycle, including parsing, planning, and scheduling.
- Distributes tasks to worker nodes for execution.

2. **Workers:**
- Execute tasks assigned by the coordinator.
- Perform data processing tasks like reading from data sources, filtering, joining, and aggregating data.

3. **Connectors:**
- Plugins that enable Trino to communicate with various data sources.
- Provide a standardized way to access different types of data stores.

### Use Cases
1. **Data Warehousing:**
- Acts as a query layer on top of existing data warehouses, providing fast, scalable querying capabilities.

2. **Data Lakes:**
- Enables querying of large-scale data lakes, integrating data from various sources for comprehensive analysis.

3. **Real-Time Analytics:**
- Supports real-time data analysis by querying data across different systems with low latency.

4. **Business Intelligence:**
- Powers BI tools, offering fast and reliable access to large datasets for reporting and analytics.

5. **Ad Hoc Queries:**
- Facilitates exploratory data analysis with the ability to run complex, ad hoc queries on diverse data sources.

### Advantages
1. **High Performance:** Optimized for fast query execution with low latency.
2. **Scalability:** Easily scales out to handle increasing data volumes and complex queries.
3. **Flexibility:** Supports a wide range of data sources and formats, enabling comprehensive data analysis.
4. **Ease of Use:** Standard ANSI SQL support makes it accessible to users with SQL knowledge.
5. **Extensibility:** Connector architecture allows integration with new data sources and systems.

## A/B Testing

## Introduction

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. It's essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.

A/B testing allows individuals, teams, and companies to make careful changes to their user experiences while collecting data on the results. This allows them to construct hypotheses, and to learn better why certain elements of their experiences impact user behavior.

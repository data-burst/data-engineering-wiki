# Functional Testing

## Introduction
Functional testing is a type of software testing that validates the software system against the functional requirements/specifications. The purpose is to check whether your product is as per the specifications you intended for it. This testing mainly involves black box testing and it is not concerned about the source code of the application.

Functional testing checks the functionalities of the software system, the database, the network, the client-server applications, and the user interface. It ensures that the system is working as expected and the features are implemented correctly.

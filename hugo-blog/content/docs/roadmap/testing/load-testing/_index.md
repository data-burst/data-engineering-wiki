## Load Testing

## Introduction

Load testing is a type of performance testing that simulates real-world load on any software, application, or website. Its main goal is to identify performance bottlenecks before the software application goes live. The objective of load testing is not to break the target environment; instead, it is to understand how the application behaves under intense loads.

During load testing, the system is monitored to identify bottlenecks such as database configuration issues, network bottleneck, and CPU utilization. It helps in determining how the application behaves when multiple users access it simultaneously. This testing is crucial for applications that are expected to serve multiple users at the same time.

## Smoke Testing

## Introduction

**Smoke Testing**, also known as **Build Verification Testing**, is a type of software testing that comprises a non-exhaustive set of tests that aim at ensuring that the most important functions work. The result of this testing is used to decide if a build is stable enough to proceed with further testing.

The term 'smoke testing' originated in the hardware testing practice of turning on a new piece of hardware for the first time and considering it a success if it does not catch fire and smoke. In software industry, smoke testing is a shallow and wide approach whereby all areas of the application without getting into too deep, is tested.

A smoke test suite can be automated or a combination of manual and automated testing.

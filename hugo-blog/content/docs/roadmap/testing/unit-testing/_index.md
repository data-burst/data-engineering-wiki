## Unit Testing

## Introduction

Unit testing is a **software testing method** where individual units of source code are tested to determine if they function correctly. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application and can be a function, method, procedure, module, or object.

Unit tests are typically automated and written by software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended. By writing tests for each function or module, developers can ensure that changes or additions to the code do not break existing functionality, leading to a more robust and maintainable codebase.

### The Importance of Unit Testing

Unit testing provides several benefits:
1. **Detects software bugs early**: Unit testing can catch defects before they become more serious issues. This can save both time and money in the software development process.
2. **Facilitates change**: Unit tests can provide a safety net that allows developers to make changes to code with confidence, knowing that if something breaks, it will be caught by the tests.
3. **Simplifies integration**: By testing each unit of code individually, integration becomes much easier as you can be confident that each unit is working correctly.

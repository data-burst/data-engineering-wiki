# Bitbucket

## Introduction

**Bitbucket** is another web-based platform for version control, similar to GitHub. It is particularly popular among teams using the Atlassian suite of tools. Here's what you need to know about Bitbucket:

1. **Mercurial and Git Support**: Unlike GitHub (which primarily supports Git), Bitbucket supports both Git and Mercurial repositories.

2. **Private Repositories**: Bitbucket allows free private repositories, making it a good choice for closed-source projects.

3. **Integration with Jira**: Bitbucket integrates seamlessly with Jira, Atlassian's issue and project tracking tool.

4. **Access Control**: Bitbucket provides fine-grained access control, allowing you to manage permissions at the repository, branch, and user levels.

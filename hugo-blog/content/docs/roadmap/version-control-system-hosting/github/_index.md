# GitHub

## Introduction

**GitHub** is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration. It provides tools for managing and tracking changes to code repositories. Here are some key points about GitHub:

1. **Git Hosting**: GitHub hosts Git repositories, making it easy for developers to collaborate on projects. It offers features like pull requests, issues, and project boards.

2. **Social Coding**: GitHub encourages social coding by allowing developers to fork repositories, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with others.

3. **Repositories**: Each project on GitHub has a repository where code, documentation, and other files are stored. Repositories can be public (visible to everyone) or private (restricted access).

4. **Issues and Pull Requests**: Developers can create issues to track tasks, bugs, or feature requests. Pull requests allow contributors to propose changes and collaborate on code.

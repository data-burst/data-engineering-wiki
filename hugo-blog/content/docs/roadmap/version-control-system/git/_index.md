# Git

## Introduction

**Git** is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code locally. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git is used to collaborate on code and helps you keep track of code changes. It provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set. Git is used in the terminal view and learning this way gives you a good grasp of how Git works.
